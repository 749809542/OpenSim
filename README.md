# OpenSim

OpenSim is an open source alternative for [SimPholders](https://simpholders.com), written in Swift. It's working for Xcode 7.

You can visit the latest [release](https://github.com/luosheng/OpenSim/releases) to grab a compiled version. (Warning: It's not code-signed.)

## TODO

- [ ] Parsing results from `xcrun` command rather than `device_set.plist` file
- [ ] Better UI
- [x] Watch for changes from simulators directory and reload dynamically
- [ ] Other functionalities like uninstalling apps or resetting data
